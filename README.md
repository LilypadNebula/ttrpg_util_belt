# TTRPG Utility Belt

## A utility belt of helpful tools for your tabletop roleplaying games

### Included tools

- Clocks
  - Create clocks for tracking things in your game. Expanded descriptions can be found in games like Apocalypse World or Blades in the Dark, but basically, you can create a clock for most anything that is going to change at some point or trigger an event. Relations with a faction, a chase scene, progress on a project, anything that has an end point and roughly trackable steps.
- NPC Generator
  - Create random NPCs with a name, description, and section for notes. View your created NPCs and go back to them for updates.
